# Desciption
KuduKs wonderful Reduce gtk2 theme.
http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Reduce?content=123505

I was amazed with the pixmap work. Moved it over to a murrine gtkrc, cause some apps did not play well with just pixbuf engine. Fixed panel button normal,active,prelight sequence.

Tweeked just a few pixmaps only because I did my color change. If you like icons on your buttons and menu, open up the gtkrc file and comment out # the first two lines gtk-menu-images = 0 gtk-button-images = 0

If you want your file manager side pane the same color as your base window, comment out # GtkTreeView::even-row-color= \"#4F4444\"

I removed the iconrc cause it was not complete and I could not do it justice. I am using, http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Snow+sabre?content=123559

Finally, I left out the pixmap spin buttons and arrows and let murrine handle them. Just my artistic choice.

So for all you freedom fighters:
Then there\'s Maude. Oops I meant... ZenzaireMauve
